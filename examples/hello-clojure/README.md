A simple ClojureScript application illustrating usage of the External Game Interface (EGI).

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

This will start a developement server for you at <http://localhost:3449>.

Now start up the Play[dev] tool by going to <https://play.dividat.com/playDev.html#play/http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A3449/%7B%7Dhttps://play.dividat.com/playDev.html#play/http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A3449/%7B%7D> or by going to <https://play.dividat.com/playDev.html> and entering the URL of the development server.
