# hello-clojure

Example project on how to use the EGI from a Clojurescript project.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

Now start the playdev pointing to figwheel:

    playdev http://localhost:3449

This will open a window with the EGI and the simple clojure script app working.
