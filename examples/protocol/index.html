  <h1>External Game Interface</h1>
  <p>This is a test and example usage of the External Game Interface (EGI).</p>
  <p>The current page is loaded in an iframe from Dividat Play. Hardware input signals are forwarded from Play to this iframe and are usable as controls for your own game.</p>
  <p>Open the javascript console and have a look at the source code of this page to see how the protocol works!</p>

  <button onclick="egi.ready()">Ready</button>
  <button onclick="egi.pong()">Pong</button>
  <button onclick="egi.finish()">Finish</button>
  <button onclick="egi.suspend()">Suspend</button>
  <button onclick="egi.abort()">Abort</button>
  <button onclick="throwError()">Error</button>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    var egi = PlayEGI((signal) => {
      switch (signal.type){

          console.log("Got a Hello from Play and some settings:", signal.settings)
          // Once we are ready and loaded:
          // egi.ready()
          console.log("Hit the Ready button!")

        case 'Resume':
          //  When our game starts it should be in a supsended (paused) state. Only once we get the resume we can start playing.
          console.log("Got Resume from Play. Let us resume playing.")
          // Similarly a game can be suspended/paused by using `egi.suspend()`. Game should suspend until a "Resume" signal is received.

        case 'Ping':
          // This tests liveliness of the game and should be responded with a pong.
